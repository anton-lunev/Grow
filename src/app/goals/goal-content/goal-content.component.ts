      Developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customersâ€”such as early adopters thought to be more forgiving, 
      more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. 
      This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seeks to maximize information about the customer 
      per amount of money spent. "The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount 
      of validated learning about customers with the least effort."`,
